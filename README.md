# ZSBots
Bots I'm making for the Garry's Mod Zombie Survival gamemode.
I'm making them as a spiritual successor to AZBot and D3Bot cause those ones aren't really that great.

I started development on these ZSBots back in early 2018 and have been working on them ever since.

to add a bot: zs_bot_add

if the bots aren't moving then type nav_generate into the console
