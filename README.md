# ZSBots
Bots I'm making for the Garry's Mod Zombie Survival gamemode.
I'm making them as a spiritual successor to AZBot and D3Bot cause those ones aren't really that great.

I started development on these ZSBots back in early 2018 and have been working on them ever since.

If the bots aren't moving then type nav_generate into the console.

ulx commands:
!addzsbot
!kickzsbots
!slayzsbots
!zsbotsay

console commands:
zs_bot_add
zs_bot_kick
zs_bot_kill

console variables:
zs_bot_can_cade
zs_bot_can_pick_up_loot
